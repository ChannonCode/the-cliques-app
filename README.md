# The Cliques App

This is a Flutter Firebase mobile app to showcase on Sam Channons portfolio. The entire purpose of this app is to display my skills with Flutter and Firebase. The app and backend are entirely designed, created and maintained by Sam Channon

## The Idea

The objective is to create a social media app based around enhancing group chats. Allows the creation of groups or Cliques where memebers can chat, post and rsvp to events, store pictures or memories with each event, search for new Cliqeus to join and offer typical social media profile management.

## Completed features
    1. Firebase authentication(User sign up and login, along with a guest mode)

## Coming soon

    2. Clique creation
